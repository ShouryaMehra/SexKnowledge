<b>   1:</b> 	 Transgender people live crazy lives.This is probably the most common misconception about trans people.Many people incorrectly associate being transgender with automatically living an “crazy lifestyle” based on tv and in the movies. This may involve drag performance, hyper-masculine or hyper-feminine behavior, drugs, or prostitution.<br/></P>

<b>    2:</b>	 Transgender people are confused.Trans people have a gender.  They are men, women, queer, and other genders.They know their sex and they know their gender.This can be confusing to us who inhabit more traditional gender roles, but to the transgender person,it is not confusing.It is just who they are.<br/></p>

<b>    3:</b> 	 Transgender people are mentally disturbed.It’s true that many transgender people suffer from mental illness.But it’s not because of their gender identity alone!It’s because in a patriarchal society, being gender variant causes a lot of distress.<br/></p>

<b>    4:</b> 	 Transgender people are radical liberals with crazy ideas.Transgender people come from all political and religious backgrounds.Other trans people feel very strongly about changing the system that has oppressed them and adapt more radical beliefs about the gender system.Each Transgender people will make a unique decision about the life they want to lead.<br/></P>

<b>    5:</b>	 Transgender people hate their bodies.This is a very common myth.  It does make sense that a person who identifies as a woman might be uncomfortable in her male body, and vice versa. Others choose to live with their bodies as they are.On the contrary, a transgender person can love themselves through the whole process of transitioning.And we can love them too.<br/></p>
